# Options:
#
# --openssldir  install OpenSSL in OPENSSLDIR (Default: DIR/ssl if the
#               --prefix option is given; /usr/local/ssl otherwise)
# --prefix      prefix for the OpenSSL include, lib and bin directories
#               (Default: the OPENSSLDIR directory)
#
# --install_prefix  Additional prefix for package builders (empty by
#               default).  This needn't be set in advance, you can
#               just as well use "make INSTALL_PREFIX=/whatever install".
#
# --with-krb5-dir  Declare where Kerberos 5 lives.  The libraries are expected
#		to live in the subdirectory lib/ and the header files in
#		include/.  A value is required.
# --with-krb5-lib  Declare where the Kerberos 5 libraries live.  A value is
#		required.
#		(Default: KRB5_DIR/lib)
# --with-krb5-include  Declare where the Kerberos 5 header files live.  A
#		value is required.
#		(Default: KRB5_DIR/include)
# --with-krb5-flavor  Declare what flavor of Kerberos 5 is used.  Currently
#		supported values are "MIT" and "Heimdal".  A value is required.
#
# --test-sanity Make a number of sanity checks on the data in this file.
#               This is a debugging tool for OpenSSL developers.
#
# no-hw-xxx     do not compile support for specific crypto hardware.
#               Generic OpenSSL-style methods relating to this support
#               are always compiled but return NULL if the hardware
#               support isn't compiled.
# no-hw         do not compile support for any crypto hardware.
# [no-]threads  [don't] try to create a library that is suitable for
#               multithreaded applications (default is "threads" if we
#               know how to do it)
# [no-]shared	[don't] try to create shared libraries when supported.
# no-asm        do not use assembler
# no-dso        do not compile in any native shared-library methods. This
#               will ensure that all methods just return NULL.
# no-krb5       do not compile in any KRB5 library or code.
# [no-]zlib     [don't] compile support for zlib compression.
# zlib-dynamic	Like "zlib", but the zlib library is expected to be a shared
#		library and will be loaded in run-time by the OpenSSL library.
# enable-montasm 0.9.8 branch only: enable Montgomery x86 assembler backport
#               from 0.9.9
