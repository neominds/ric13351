0 finally it gets released.

    Added a SSL_OP_EPHEMERAL_RSA option which causes all SSLv3 RSA keys to
    use a temporary RSA key.  This is experimental and needs some more work.
    Fixed a few Win16 build problems.

    SSLv3 bug. I was not doing the 'lookup' of the CERT structure
    correctly. I was taking the SSL->ctx->default_cert when I should
    have been using SSL->cert. The bug was in ssl/s3_srvr.c

20-Jun-97
    X509_ATTRIBUTES were being encoded wrongly by apps/reg.c and the
    rest of the library. Even though I had the code required to do
    it correctly, apps/req.c was doing the wrong thing.  I have fixed
    and tested everything.

    Missing a few #ifdef FIONBIO sections in crypto/bio/bss_acpt.c.

19-Jun-97
    Fixed a bug in the SSLv2 server side first packet handling. When
    using the non-blocking test BIO, the ssl->s2->first_packet flag
    was being reset when a would-block failure occurred when reading
    the first 5 bytes of the first packet. This caused the checking
    logic to run at the wrong time and cause an error.

    Fixed a problem with specifying cipher. If RC4-MD5 were used,
    only the SSLv3 version would be picked up.  Now this will pick
    up both SSLv2 and SSLv3 versions. This required changing the
    SSL_CIPHER->mask values so that they only mask the ciphers,
    digests, authentication, export type and key-exchange algorithms.

    I found that when a SSLv23 session is established, a reused
    session, of type SSLv3 was attempting to write the SSLv2 
    ciphers, which were invalid. The SSL_METHOD->put_cipher_by_char 
    method has been modified so it will only write out cipher which
    that method knows about.  


 Changes between 0.8.0 and 0.8.1

  *) Mostly bug fixes. 
     There is an Ephemeral DH cipher problem which is fixed.

 SSLeay 0.8.0

This version of SSLeay has quite a lot of things different from the
previous version.

Basically check all callback parameters, I will be producing documentation
about how to use things in th future.  Currently I'm just getting 080 out
the door.  Please not that there are several ways to do everything, and
most of the applications in the apps directory are hybrids, some using old
methods and some using new methods.

Have a look in demos/bio for some very simple programs and
apps/s_client.c and apps/s_server.c for some more advanced versions.
Notes are definitly needed but they are a week or so away.

Anyway, some quick nots from Tim Hudson (tjh@cryptsoft.com)

Quick porting notes for moving from SSLeay-0.6.x to SSLeay-0.8.x to
get those people that want to move to using the new code base off to
a quick start.

Note that Eric has tidied up a lot of the areas of the API that were
less than desirable and renamed quite a few things (as he had to break
the API in lots of places anyrate). There are a whole pile of additional
functions for making dealing with (and creating) certificates a lot
cleaner.
