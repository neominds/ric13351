More number for the questions about SSL overheads....

The following numbers were generated on a pentium pro 200, running linux.
They give an indication of the SSL protocol and encryption overheads.

The program that generated them is an unreleased version of ssl/ssltest.c
which is the SSLeay ssl protocol testing program.  It is a single process that
talks both sides of the SSL protocol via a non-blocking memory buffer
interface.

How do I read this?  The protocol and cipher are reasonable obvious.
The next number is the number of connections being made.  The next is the
number of bytes exchanged bewteen the client and server side of the protocol.
This is the number of bytes that the client sends to the server, and then
the server sends back.  Because this is all happening in one process,
the data is being encrypted, decrypted, encrypted and then decrypted again.
It is a round trip of that many bytes.  Because the one process performs
both the client and server sides of the protocol and it sends this many bytes
each direction, multiply this number by 4 to generate the number
of bytes encrypted/decrypted/MACed.  The first time value is how many seconds
elapsed doing a full SSL handshake, the second is the cost of one
full handshake and the rest being session-id reuse.
