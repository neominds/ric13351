    LOCAL_MEM_SIZE. The memory map will accomodate up to 128MB of SDRAM.

     CoreLV Module
          With MIPS 4kec Core and GT-64120 bridge chip

     USB controller (PIIX4-resident)
          Supported with the Wind River USB protocol stack.

     Bootrom
          A VxWorks bootrom prepared with make bootrom.hex is supported, which
          will load a vxWorks or vxWorks.st image across the ethernet device.

  Unsupported Features
     The following features of the Malta board are not supported:

     The PIIX4 RTC is not supported. However, the non-volatile storage in the
     RTC is used to store the boot line. Changes made to the boot line will be
     written to this non-volatile memory and read at boot time.

     LOCAL_MEM_AUTOSIZE is untested in this BSP.

     Rom-resident VxWorks images are not supported.

     The SMsC FDC73M81X device is used for the two UART devices contained
     therein. the Parallel Port, Mouse and Keyboard functions are not supported.
     Future versions of the BSP will support these functions.

     The third RS-232 serial device is not supported.

     The EEPROM device is not supported.

HARDWARE DETAILS
     This section documents the details of the device drivers and board hardware
     elements.

  Devices
     The MALTA 4kec board has three serial ports; The first two ports are
     implemented in the SMsC FDC73M81X Super I/O device. Both ports are
     supported via the vxWorks standard ns16550 driver. The third serial port is
     not supported.

     A cache library compatible with the MIPS 4kec processor is supplied:

         cache4kcLib.c - high-level MIPS 4kc cache support library
         cache4kcALib.s - low-level MIPS 4kc cache support library

     The following are not included in this BSP, but are referenced by it, and
     are included with the VxWorks standard driver libraries:

         ns16550Sio.o - 16550-compatible serial port driver
         mipsR4kTimer.o - MIPS R4000-style timer driver

  Memory Maps
     The MIPS 4kec CPU Core includes a 512 Mbyte physical address space with
     on-board RAM, ROM, and PCI Bus areas. The memory regions of interest in
     this address space are listed in the table below.
