SSL_set_default_verify_paths() ... renamed to the more appropriate
SSL_CTX_set_default_verify_paths()

If you want to use client certificates then you have to add in a bit
of extra stuff in that a SSLv3 server sends a list of those CAs that
it will accept certificates from ... so you have to provide a list to
SSLeay otherwise certain browsers will not send client certs.

SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list(ctx,SSL_load_client_CA_file(s_cert_file));


X509_NAME_oneline(X)    -> X509_NAME_oneline(X,NULL,0)  
               or provide a buffer and size to copy the
               result into

X509_add_cert ->  X509_STORE_add_cert (and you might want to read the
          notes on X509_NAME structure changes too)


VERIFICATION CODE
=================

The codes have all be renamed from VERIFY_ERR_* to X509_V_ERR_* to
more accurately reflect things.

The verification callback args are now packaged differently so that
extra fields for verification can be added easily in future without
having to break things by adding extra parameters each release :-)

X509_cert_verify_error_string -> X509_verify_cert_error_string


BIO INTERNALS
=============

Eric has fixed things so that extra flags can be introduced in
the BIO layer in future without having to play with all the BIO
modules by adding in some macros.

The ugly stuff using 
    b->flags ~= (BIO_FLAGS_RW|BIO_FLAGS_SHOULD_RETRY)
becomes
    BIO_clear_retry_flags(b)

    b->flags |= (BIO_FLAGS_READ|BIO_FLAGS_SHOULD_RETRY)
becomes
    BIO_set_retry_read(b)

Also ... BIO_get_retry_flags(b), BIO_set_flags(b)



OTHER THINGS
============

X509_NAME has been altered so that it isn't just a STACK ... the STACK
is now in the "entries" field ... and there are a pile of nice functions
for getting at the details in a much cleaner manner.

SSL_CTX has been altered ... "cert" is no longer a direct member of this
structure ... things are now down under "cert_store" (see x5
