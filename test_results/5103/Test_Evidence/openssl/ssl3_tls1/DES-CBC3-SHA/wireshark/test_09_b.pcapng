checking the RS-232
     connection.

     This BSP assumes a clock oscillator module frequency of 25 MHz.

NOTE
     Due to the nature of the CoreLV board as a test platform which allows
     vendors to validate silicon and provide early samples in an evaluation
     form, Specification Updates provided with each manufacturer's device should
     be carefully reviewed for any errata which may affect operation with this
     BSP. Though this BSP was originally developed using the TI F731940 (4kc)
     device, support has been (and may be again in the future) added for
     additional processor cores. Refer to the "Known Problems" section for
     specific instructions related to using the particular vendor's device
     supported by this BSP.

  Boot ROMs
     The Malta board contains 4 Megabytes of in-circuit programmable Flash
     Memory.

     Bootroms can be downloaded via a parallel port connection. When the dip
     switch S5-1 is set to ON position, the system will enter into the flash
     programming mode. The 1284 Flash Download Format is documented in the Malta
     User's Manual, chapter 8. See the section on "ROM Considerations" below for
     further information.

  Boot Parameters
     This board provides non-volatile (Battery backed-up) memory in the 82371
     PIIX4 south bridge chip that is used for storage of the boot parameters.

  Switches
     The following switches are relevant to VxWorks configuration. Consult the
     hardware manual for switch configuration details.
